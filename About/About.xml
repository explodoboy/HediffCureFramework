I Have The Cure! is a framework mod that allows hediffs to immediately remove other hediffs, until the curing hediff no longer exists; for example, an implant or drug that can instantly cure a disease, removing it instantly from the body. It works with everything, from the Flu to Brain Damage, and theoretically lost limbs and even instantly removing bionics, if you wanted to do so for whatever reason.</description>
